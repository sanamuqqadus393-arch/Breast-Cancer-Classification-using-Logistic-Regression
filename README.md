# **Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression**

## **Overview**
This project predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using logistic regression. It uses the breast cancer dataset from scikit learn and demonstrates basic data analysis, model training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is included in this repository.
